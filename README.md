## merging using R

The implementation of this script is to rearrange the columns of a data frame to a new one based on our needs.

## Libraries:

```
no library needed. We only to use the R base.
```

## The Funtion

the function is located in the file named "Merge.R" and defined as follows:
```
mergi<-function(df,y,z)
```
where:
- df: the data frame at hand
- y: the column or columns we need to change their positions. It can be one columns or many columns as y can be a vector
- z: our new position in the data frame at which the vector y will be placed


## Running the Script

```
line 28 to 29:      func(x,y)    please write the function of interest
line 31: range of x 
line 32: range of y
line 36: x,y,z=plot_values(x, y, func) after providing the above values, please run this code in order the values x,y,z for the plot
line 39 to 49: those are needed for the plot
line 48: you can the change the elevation angle using [elev] and the rotation angle using [azim]
```

## Exmaple

 I have provided an example of the following function $$x^{3}-6xy +y^{3}$$

 The results are shown in the image below:
